Analysis of Multi-Objective Strategy Adaptation by Particle Swarm for Network Queue Problems

Processes composed of queueing networks with interdependent queues are present in
several areas. In the design, these projects need special attention in allocating resources
in the buffer areas. The proper allocation of these resources generates financial savings
and improvement in the service quality to demand. Single server queueing networks,
arbitrary acyclic topologies with Markov arrivals, and general services are considered in
this study. An approach for optimal buffer allocation in a queueing network with split
topology is presented. The methodology uses a multiobjective heuristic strategy through
the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. The main interest is verifying the impacts
of variations in the service capacity and changes in the routing probabilities in the merge
topology between the network queueing. These impacts have direct repercussions on
the solutions produced by the optimization heuristic. It is essential to check whether,
even with these variations, the provided solutions remain consistent with the structure
of the optimization problem under study. Several results of computational experiments
confirm the effectiveness of the methodology.
